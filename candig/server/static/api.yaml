      summary: Gets a list of ReadAlignment s for one or more ReadGroup s.
      description: |-
        searchReads operates over a genomic coordinate space of reference sequence
        and position defined by the Reference s to which the requested ReadGroup s are
        aligned.

        If a target positional range is specified, search returns all reads whose
        alignment to the reference genome *overlap* the range. A query which specifies
        only read group IDs yields all reads in those read groups, including unmapped
        reads.

        All reads returned (including reads on subsequent pages) are ordered by genomic
        coordinate (by reference sequence, then position). Reads with equivalent genomic
        coordinates are returned in an unspecified order. This order must be consistent
        for a given repository, such that two queries for the same content (regardless
        of page size) yield reads in the same order across their respective streams of
        paginated responses.

        POST /reads/search must accept a JSON version of SearchReadsRequest as
        the post body and will return a JSON version of SearchReadsResponse.

      description: |-
        Describes the different types of CIGAR alignment operations that exist.
        Used wherever CIGAR alignments are used.

         - OPERATION_UNSPECIFIED: The null operation.
         - ALIGNMENT_MATCH: An alignment match indicates that a sequence can be aligned to the
        reference without evidence of an INDEL. Unlike the
        SEQUENCE_MATCH and SEQUENCE_MISMATCH operators,
        the ALIGNMENT_MATCH operator does not indicate whether the
        reference and read sequences are an exact match. This operator is
        equivalent to SAM's M.
         - INSERT: The insert operator indicates that the read contains evidence of bases
        being inserted into the reference. This operator is equivalent to SAM's
        I.
         - DELETE: The delete operator indicates that the read contains evidence of bases
        being deleted from the reference. This operator is equivalent to SAM's
        D.
         - SKIP: The skip operator indicates that this read skips a long segment of the
        reference, but the bases have not been deleted. This operator is commonly
        used when working with RNA-seq data, where reads may skip long segments
        of the reference between exons. This operator is equivalent to SAM's
        N.
         - CLIP_SOFT: The soft clip operator indicates that bases at the start/end of a read
        have not been considered during alignment. This may occur if the majority
        of a read maps, except for low quality bases at the start/end of a read.
        This operator is equivalent to SAM's S. Bases that are soft
        clipped will still be stored in the read.
         - CLIP_HARD: The hard clip operator indicates that bases at the start/end of a read
        have been omitted from this alignment. This may occur if this linear
        alignment is part of a chimeric alignment, or if the read has been
        trimmed (for example, during error correction or to trim poly-A tails for
        RNA-seq). This operator is equivalent to SAM's H.
         - PAD: The pad operator indicates that there is padding in an alignment. This
        operator is equivalent to SAM's P.
         - SEQUENCE_MATCH: This operator indicates that this portion of the aligned sequence exactly
        matches the reference. This operator is equivalent to SAM's =.
         - SEQUENCE_MISMATCH: This operator indicates that this portion of the aligned sequence is an
        alignment match to the reference, but a sequence mismatch. This can
        indicate a SNP or a read error. This operator is equivalent to SAM's
        X.

            A secondary alignment represents an alternative to the primary alignment
            for this read. Aligners may return secondary alignments if a read can map
            ambiguously to multiple coordinates in the genome.

            Supplementary alignments are used in the representation of a chimeric
            alignment. In a chimeric alignment, a read is split into multiple
            linear alignments that map to different reference contigs. The first
            linear alignment in the read will be designated as the representative
            alignment; the remaining linear alignments will be designated as
            supplementary alignments. These alignments may have different mapping
            quality scores.

            In each linear alignment in a chimeric alignment, the read will be hard
            clipped. The alignedSequence and alignedQuality fields in the alignment
            message will only represent the bases for its respective linear alignment.

            To compute this checksum, make a list of Reference.md5checksum for all

            all the strings concatenated together. Express the hash as a lower-case

        Struct represents a structured data value, consisting of fields
        which map to dynamically typed values. In some languages, Struct
        might be supported by a native representation. For example, in
        scripting languages like JS a struct is represented as an
        object. The details of that representation are described together
        with the proto support for the language.

        The JSON representation for Struct is JSON object.
