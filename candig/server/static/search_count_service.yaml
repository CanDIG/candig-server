    ## Below is the search and count API description. Note that this was primarily prepared for advanced users. You should refer to the API Usage section under our [Read the Docs](https://candig-server.readthedocs.io) for more instructions.

    ## If you wish to view the UI for all other endpoints, please select their definition on the top right corner.

    ### Warning: developers, This spec is not really machine-readable. Please use with caution. In particular, we are unable to provide accurate machine-readable definitions for the Response of `/count` endpoint. We are also unable to express the recursive relations of the `logic` component of the complex requests.

            Warning:
            ---
            We are unable to provide an accurate machine-readable definition for the response format of count requests. As the /count endpoint returns actual values of the fields you search for as the key, and their aggregated counts as the values, we do not know the keys beforehand. 
            ---
            However, the schema has defined the possible fields that may be aggregated on. You should refer to those fields.
            ---
            As an example, if you specify this as your `results` section.
            ---

        A Call represents the determination of genotype with respect to a

        It may include associated information such as quality
        and phasing. For example, a call might assign a probability of 0.32 to
        the occurrence of a SNP named rs1234 in a call set with the name NA12345.

        There are three different basic types of logic objects.
        
        First one is an `and` logic, where you can find records that satisfy all of the components. 
        
        Second one is an `or` logic, where you find records that satisfy any of the components. 
        
        Third type is simply an `id`. If you are only a single component, you may only specify `id` in the logic. For the last type only, you can specify an optional `negate`, which simply negates the logic of your only component.
        
        These should suffice most of the needs. For more advanced usage, such as recursive relations, check our latest docs hosted on readthedocs. They are too complicated to be expressed here.
