The candig-server is a CanDIG project, aiming to provide distributed, secure data access
to participating institutions across Canada. You can learn more about our work from
https://www.distributedgenomics.ca

`GA4GH <http://genomicsandhealth.org/>`_
defined an `API <https://ga4gh-schemas.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>`_
to facilitate interoperable exchange of genomic data, and implemented a reference server,
but the development was ceased.

Since the CanDIG Team took over, we have focused on adding native support for peer-to-peer
communications, upgrading the codebase to be Python 3 compatiable, as well as clinical
and pipeline metadata support.
